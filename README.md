## Minimum Viable Product (MVP):
- Have Simon buttons, that are clickable
- Visible score, that updates
- Have Simon set a pattern.
- Have Simon listen for an exact match for pattern
- If pattern matches, score points, else lose.
## Stretch Goals:
- Color coded patterns. => color "lights up" to show selected pattern
- Sounds
- Pop up lose section.
- Button that causes Simon pieces to start moving.
- Time base scoring
- Over time leaderboard.
- Mobile optimization
## User Stories:
- As a player, I want to push the Simon buttons after Simon tells me to, so that I can increase my score
- As a player, I want to track my score over time.

## Major Hurdles:
- Evaluating the player input to the computer input, as the player clicks. 
- Displaying the animations and sounds in sequence without overriding each other.
